# Transit Infrastructure Project Overview

## Project Description

This project focuses on analyzing a comprehensive transit infrastructure dataset sourced from the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers (OICA). The dataset covers transit-infrastructure projects worldwide, spanning 59 countries and 184 cities. It provides detailed information on construction costs, corridor lengths, and project timelines.

## Dataset Documentation

### Data File
- **File Name:** Transit_cost.csv
- **Download Date:** October 12, 2023
- **Source:** [https://transitcosts.com/](https://transitcosts.com/)
- **Managed by:** NYU Marron Institute of Urban Management

### Dataset Structure
- **Variables:** ID, country, city, line, start_year, end_year, rr, length, tunnel_per, tunnel, stations, source1, cost, currency, year, ppp_rate, real_cost, cost_km_millions, source2, reference.

### Validity and Limitations
- The dataset draws data from diverse sources, including official plans, media reports, and reliable publications.
- Trustworthiness is maintained through continuous updates and case studies.
- Limitations include potential data incompleteness and biases due to source reliability.

## Data Preview

The data is previewed and visualized using scatter plots to showcase the relationship between transit project cost, length, and project timelines.

## Research Questions

1. **Top Transit Projects:** Identify the top 10 countries with the highest number of transit projects.
2. **Cost and Length Relationship:** Explore the relationship between length and cost per km for the top 5 countries.
3. **Total Kilometers Constructed:** Determine which country has constructed the most kilometers of transit.
4. **City with Most Stations:** Identify the city in the country with the highest number of stations.
5. **Construction Timelines:** Analyze variations in the mean duration required to complete transit projects across different countries.

## Data Exploration

The project explores research questions using visualizations, summarizing key findings and insights. Notable analyses include:

- Identifying top countries with the most transit projects.
- Analyzing the relationship between length and cost per km.
- Determining the total kilometers constructed by country.
- Identifying the city with the most transit stations in the country with the highest station count.
- Exploring variations in mean project duration across different countries.

## Log-Log Plot Analysis

A log-log plot is utilized to reveal the logarithmic relationship between transit line length and real cost, emphasizing exponential cost escalation with longer lines.

## Summary and Conclusion

The project offers a comprehensive overview of global transit infrastructure, providing valuable insights into project counts, cost dynamics, construction timelines, and more. It emphasizes the importance of data reliability, acknowledges potential limitations, and encourages thorough validation processes.
